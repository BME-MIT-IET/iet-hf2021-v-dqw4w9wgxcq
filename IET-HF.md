# Goals of the project
Our goal with this fork is to clean up, and improve the quality of the original
code. To assist with this, we plan on:
- Upgrading the original build system to be based on Gradle
- Setting up basic CI using Github Actions
- Setting up static analysis to reduce the efforts required for manual review 
- Doing manual review to discover issues missed by the automated tools
- Creating performance tests
- Planning and performing manual testing
