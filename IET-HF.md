# Goals of the project
Our goal with this fork is to clean up, and improve the quality of the original
code. To assist with this, we plan on:
- Upgrading the original build system to be based on Gradle (#6)
- Setting up basic CI using Github Actions (#6)
- Setting up static analysis to reduce the efforts required for manual review
with SonarQube (subtask of #7)
- Doing manual review to discover issues missed by the automated tools (subtask
of #7)
- Creating performance tests (#8)
- Planning and performing manual (exploratory) testing (#10)
